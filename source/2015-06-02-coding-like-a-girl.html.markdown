Taking a break from blogging while I rebuild my development machine.
Meanwhile, enjoy an article by sailor mercury about [femininity and
programming][coding-like-a-girl]. I liked this tip:

> **Assume people are as or more qualified than you.**
> 
> If youâ€™re at a conference and talking to a feminine presenting person,
> assume they are an expert in the field of the conference.
> 
> Before you are about to explain a paper condescendingly to someone in a
> dress, assume that they wrote it.

This is probably good advice when talking to anybody about anything.
